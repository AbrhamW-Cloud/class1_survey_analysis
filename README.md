
# Class 1 Survey Data Analysis

## Project Description

This repository contains my HW5 analysis for the class survey dataset (`class1_survey.csv`).  
The goal is to practice data management and statistical modeling using R and R Markdown,  
and to summarize key patterns in the survey responses in a reproducible report.

## Files Included

- `analysis_code.Rmd`: R Markdown file with all code, narrative text, and results for the HW5 analysis.
- `class1_survey.csv`: Class survey data used in the analysis (one row per respondent).
- `README.md`: This file.

## What the Code Does

- Imports `class1_survey.csv` into R.
- Performs basic data cleaning and recoding of variables needed for the assignment.
- Produces descriptive summaries and simple visualizations of key survey variables.
- Fits the required statistical models for HW5 (e.g., associations between selected predictors and outcomes).
- Displays results as tables and figures within the knitted R Markdown report.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure `class1_survey.csv` is in the same directory as `analysis_code.Rmd` (or in the path used in the code).
3. Open `analysis_code.Rmd` in RStudio.
4. Install any R packages that are loaded at the top of the Rmd if you do not already have them.
5. Click **Knit** in RStudio to generate the report.
